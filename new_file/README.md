# 2048 Large Edition

This project is an extended version of the classic 2048 game, featuring a larger 16x16 board with a 4x4 sliding window.

## Getting Started

To play the game, simply open the `2048slide.html` file in a web browser.

## Development

The game logic is implemented in `2048slide.js`, with styling provided by `2048slide.css`.

## Todo List

- Implement the `moveWindow` function to handle the sliding window's movement.
- Implement the `moveTiles` function to handle the movement of tiles within the sliding window.
- Add functionality to merge tiles and update the score.
- Implement game over logic and a restart feature.
- Enhance the user interface and improve the visual design.
- Add support for touch events for mobile devices.
- Write unit tests for the game logic.
